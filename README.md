# PRODIGY_ML_Task1
This repository features a linear regression model for predicting house prices, developed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The project included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model implementation using Python and scikit-learn, with evaluation metrics such as MAE and R-squared.

# Project Highlights:

## Data Collection and Preprocessing: 
Utilized a comprehensive dataset, handling missing values and preparing the data for analysis.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Conducted EDA to visualize relationships between features and house prices, identifying key trends.
## Model Development: 
Implemented a linear regression model using Python and scikit-learn, with rigorous evaluation metrics.
## Model Evaluation: 
Assessed model performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared values.
## Dataset:
The dataset used for this project can be found on Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
