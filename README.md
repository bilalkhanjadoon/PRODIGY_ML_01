# PRODIGY_ML_Task1
This repository features a linear regression model for predicting house prices, developed during my internship at Prodigy InfoTech. The project included data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and model implementation using Python and scikit-learn, with evaluation metrics such as MAE and R-squared.
